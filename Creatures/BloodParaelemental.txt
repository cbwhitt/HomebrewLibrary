Blood Mastery (Ex):
	A blood paraelemental receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against enemies affected by its enraging wound ability.

Enraging Wound (Su):
	A blood paraelementalâ€™s attacks cause a persistent wound. An injured creature loses 2 hit points at the start of each of their turns. The wound does not heal naturally and resists healing spells. It can be healed with a successful Heal check, a cure spell, or a heal spell (or equivalent), but a character attempting to heal the wound magically in this way must succeed on a caster level check. 
	Additionally, when a creature becomes wounded, it must succeed on a Will saving throw or become enraged as the spell 'rage' for as long as it remains wounded. A character can willingly fail this save. A blood paraelemental receives a cumulative +2 bonus to Strength and Constitution for each enemy enraged this way for as long as that enemy remains enraged. The maximum bonus a paraelemental can accrue in this manner is based on its size, as shown below.

Table: Maximum Strength and Constitution Bonus by Size
:: Size		:: Maximum Bonus	::
------------------------------------------
:: Tiny		:: +0			::
:: Small	:: +2			::
:: Medium	:: +2			::
:: Large	:: +4			::
:: Huge		:: +4			::
:: Greater	:: +6			::
:: Elder	:: +8			::

A character that successfully saves against this enraging effect cannot be enraged by the same blood paraelemental for 24 hours. The DC for this effect is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. The DC for a caster level check to magically heal through the wound is the same as to resist becoming enraged.
