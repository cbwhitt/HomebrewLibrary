Shadow Mastery (Ex):
	A shadow paraelemental receives a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls against enemies in shadowy illumination.

Shadowform (Su):
	A shadow paraelemental's form constantly twists and shifts making it hard to pinpoint. It has concealment (20% miss chance). In shadowy illumination (but not darkness), this bonus increases to 50%, even against foes with darkvision. 'See invisibility' does not counteract this effect, but a 'true seeing' spell does.

Shadow Sight (Ex):
	A shadowy paraelemental can see normally in regular and magical shadowy illumination as far as it could see normally.
