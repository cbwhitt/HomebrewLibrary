Lightning Mastery (Ex):
	A lightning paraelemental receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against enemies who have suffered electricity damage in the past 5 rounds, or during thunderstorms.

Ball Lightning (Ex):
	As a full-round action, a lightning paraelemental can turn into a ball and charge through its enemies, electrocuting them. It moves up to twice its speed. As part of this movement, the lightning paraelemental can move through the squares of its enemies. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The paraelemental cannot end its movement in an occupied square. Any creature whose space is completely covered by the movement in this way is subject to the ball lightning attack. The attack deals electricity damage as listed, but attacked creatures can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC is Strength-based. A lightning paraelemental can only deal damage to each target once per round, no matter how many times its movement takes it over a creature. It must wait 1d4 rounds before using this ability again.

Shock (Ex):
	A lightning paraelemental's slam attack deals bludgeoning damage plus electricity damage from the elemental's electric body.
