Level Adjustment: --

Void Mastery (Ex):
	A void paraelemental recives a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls on attacks of opportunity against enemies leaving a square it threatens.

Singularity (Ex):
	A void paraelemental can transform itself into a singularity once every 10 minutes and remain in that form for up to 1 round for every 2 HD it has, minimum 1 round. Doing so is a free action. While in this form the paraelemental collapses to a point, becoming Fine in size and receiving the corresponding bonuses to its Armor Class. The paraelemental also gains a fly speed of 10 ft. (perfect) and loses its land speed. While in this form, the paraelemental cannot make slam attacks and does not threaten the area around it, though it still provokes attacks of opportunity. Treat the elemental as occupying a grid intersection while it maintains the effect.
	The singularity creates a strong attractive force within a radius of the paraelemental, as dictated by its size. This singularity pulls in enemies, and functioning as 'Buk's singularity', except that the emanation is centered on the elemental and the bull rush bonus is based on the size of the elemental, tabulated below. Additionally, a creature that begins its turn adjacent to the singularity takes damage as indicated in the table due to the crushing force. The paraelemental suffers no ill effect if it loses the oppposed Strength check. A void paraelemental may dismiss its singularity as a free action on its turn. When the elemental grows to its original size, it must select a space adjacent to itself to grow into. If this is occupied, the elemental must overrun that opponent or be knocked prone itself.

Table: Singularity Effects by Size
:: Elemental	:: Area (radius)	:: Bull Rush Bonus	:: Damage	::
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: Tiny		:: 5 ft.		:: -8			:: 1d4		::
:: Small	:: 10 ft.		:: -2			:: 1d6		::
:: Medium	:: 15 ft.		:: +7			:: 1d8		::
:: Large	:: 20 ft.		:: +13			:: 2d8		::
:: Huge		:: 25 ft.		:: +19			:: 2d10		::
:: Greater	:: 30 ft.		:: +20			:: 2d10		::
:: Elder	:: 35 ft.		:: +21			:: 2d10		::

Void Step (Su):
	Three times per day, a void elemental can teleport as the spell 'dimension door'. They may only move up to 100 feet in this way, and it cannot take any other creatures with it. It can use this ability even in its singularity form.
