Metal Mastery (Ex):
	A metal paraelemental receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against enemies wielding metal weapons, wearing metal armor, or made of metal themselves.

Instant Weapon (Ex):
	Metal paraelementals wield special melee weapons forged from their own bodies. This weapon is treated as a manufactured weapon, but it cannot be disarmed (as it is a part of the elemental). A metal paraelemental therefore gets additional attacks with its instant weapon when making a full attack if it has a sufficiently high base attack bonus. The weapon can take nearly any form the elemental desires, duplicating the attributes of any simple or martial melee weapon. As a swift action on its turn, the elemental can change the form of the weapon (including during a full attack). The weapon otherwise functions exactly the same as one of its kind, except that it is always treated as masterwork and a metal paraelemental may select its instant weapon for feats such as Weapon Focus, counting as a fighter of level equal to its hit dice to qualify. The bonus for the feat applies to all attacks made with the weapon, regardless of form.
