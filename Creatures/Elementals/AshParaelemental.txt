Special Qualities: elemental traits
Environment: Paraelemental Plane of Ash

Ash Mastery (Ex):
	An ash paraelemental receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against enemies who have been dealt fire damage in the past 3 round or against shaken, frightened, or panicked enemies.

Smoldering Phantasm (Su):
	A creature hit by an ash paraelemental’s slam attack must succeed on a Will saving throw or be beset by powerful phantasms, perceiving themselves and their surroundings to be covered in a layer of smoldering ash. The phantasms last 1 round for every 2 HD the paraelemental has. Affected creatures are shaken for the duration, and at the start of each turn take fire damage from the embers unless they take a move action to brush off the phantasmal ash. The phantasm causes the ash to reappear every turn. This is a mind-affecting, fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +1 racial bonus. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be affected by the same ash paraelemental’s smoldering phantasm more than once every 24 hours.
