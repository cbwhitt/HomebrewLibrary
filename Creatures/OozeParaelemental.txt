Ooze Mastery (Ex):
	An ooze paraelemental receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against enemis who have been dealt acid damage in the past 5 rounds, or in muddy or marshy terrain.

Acid (Ex):
	An ooze paraelemental's body incorporates a powerful acid. It deals additional acid damage on its attacks, as indicated in its description. Creatures attacking an ooze elemental unarmed or with a natural attack suffer this same damage.

Engulf (Ex):
	A creature equal to or smaller in size than an ooze paraelemental hit by its slam attack must succeed on a Reflex saving throw or be engulfed by the paraelemental, being absorbed into its body. Engulfed creatures are subject to the paraelemental's acid and are considered to be grappled and trapped within its body. A small elemental, for example, can engulf 1 small, 2 tiny, 8 diminutive, or 32 fine creatures in this way, or any equivalent combination. This capacity changes corresponding to the paraelemental's size. (A medium paraelemental holds 1 medium, 2 mall, etc.). The save DC is Strength-based.
