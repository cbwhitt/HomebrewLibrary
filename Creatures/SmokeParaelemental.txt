Smoke Mastery (Ex):
	A smoke paraelemental receives a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls against poisoned enemies and in smoke-filled terrain.

Poison Smoke (Ex):
	Creatures fighting near a smoke paraelemental must hold their breath to avoid breathing in the toxic fumes that make up its body. A creature that starts its turn within reach of the paraelemental and isn't holding its breath must make a Fortitude save or be poisoned. Tabulated below are the corresponding Difficulty Classes and poison damage (initial and secondary) for elementals of different sizes. A creature trying to hold its breath who is deal damage (e.g. by the paraelemental's slam attack) must make a Concentration check (DC 10 + damage dealt) or be forced to start breathing until its next action. A creature forced to start breathing in this way within the reach of the paraelemental is subject to the poison smoke on its next action, even if the paraelemental moves or the creature somehow exits the area before its next action. The save DC's are Constitution-based.
