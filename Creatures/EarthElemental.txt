Earth Mastery (Ex):
	An earth elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if its foe is touching the ground.

Push (Ex):
	An earth elemental can start a bull rush maneuver without provoking an attack of opportunity. The combat modifiers given in Earth Mastery above also apply to the elemental's opposed Strength checks.

Earth Glide (Ex):
	An earth elemental can glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. A 'move earth' spell cast on an area containing a burrowing earth elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.

Earth Step (Ex):
	A stone elemental is unaffected by difficult terrain resulting from natural or unnatural earth, stone, or rock formations. For example, a stone elemental is not hindered by the uneven floor of a natural cavern. This does not prevent the stone elemental from needing to make requisite skill checks to navigate other forms of stone terrain, such as cliffs or ledges.
