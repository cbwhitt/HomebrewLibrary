Wood Mastery (Ex):
	A wood paraelemental receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against entangled or grappled enemies or enemies in dense forest.

Improved Grab (Ex):
	To use this ability, a wood paraelemental must hit with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict. A wood elemental can grab enemies of its same size or smaller in this way.

Constrict (Ex):
	A wood elemental deals its slam damage with a successful grapple check.
