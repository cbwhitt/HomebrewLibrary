Example description (from ECS pg. 287): "This creature resembles a dog, but its body is formed from iron plates and bars. It stands about two feet high at the shoulder. Its mouth is lined with serrated blades of steel."

Iron defenders are homunculi designed to assist their creators in combat, and have few useful special abilities otherwise.

Construction:
	An iron defender is forged from iron and a pint of the creator's blood. The materials cost 75 gp. Creating the body requires a DC 14 Craft (metalworking) check.
	An iron defender with additional hit dice can be created, but each additional Hit Die adds 2000 gp to the COST (not price) to create.
	Craft Construct, 'arcane eye', 'keen edge', 'mirror image', 'mending', caster must be at least 4th level; Price -- (never sold); Cost 1250 gp + 93 xp.
