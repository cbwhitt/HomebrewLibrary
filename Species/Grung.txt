A creature that successfully saves against a grung's poison is unaffected by the same grung's poison for 24 hours. A grung can harvest poison from its skin to apply to a weapon or store in a vial. Doing so is a standard action. A poison so harvested continues to act as a contact poison but loses its potency after 1 minute. A grung can also stop its poison production for 24 hours by consuming a simple herbal tonic that every grung can concoct from memory.
