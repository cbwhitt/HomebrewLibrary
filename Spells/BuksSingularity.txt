This spell creates a single point of force at the center of the area that draws in creatures and objects from all directions.

When the singularity appears, it initiates a bull rush against each creature within the area. It's bonus on these checks is 5. If the spell succeeds, it pulls that creature directly toward the center of the area by 5 feet plus 5 feet for every 5 by which it exceeded their check, stopping in a square adjacent to the singularity. Creatures closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. If a creature is pulled into a square occupied by another creature in this way, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex saving throw to avoid the pulled creature. If it succeeds, the creature is simply pulled through its space. If it fails, it is subjected to another bull rush by the spell. If it succeeds on this check, the pulled creature is knocked prone and ends its movement. Otherwise, both creatures are knocked prone and pulled the remaining distance of the first creature.

A creature that enters the area or begins its turn within it is subject to another bull rush attempt. Additionally, creatures within the area are considered flat-footed, and they treat it as difficult terrain when moving away from the singularity.

Ranged attacks made into or through the area take a -4 penalty due to the force, as do melee attacks made by creatures within the area.

Buk's Singularity can be made permanent with a 'permanency' spell.
