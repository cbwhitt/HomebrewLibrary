The stone you had held in your hand grows warmer, and as you look down you see that it has turned entirely into a compressed ball of lava. Satisfied, you hurl it at a nearby foe.

Make a ranged touch attack. An enemy hit by the lava lob takes 1d6 fire damage and becomes partially coated in lava. The lava lingers, dealing an additional 1d6 damage each subsequent round unless the target spend a full-round action wiping the lava off of themselves. The lava lasts up to 1 round per level before it cools to a maximum of 10 rounds at 10th level.
