Transmutation [Water]
Level: Hydromancer 1
Components: S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Effect: jet of water
Saving Throw: See text.
Spell Resistance: No

You gather the water between your hands and thrust your arm forward, manipulating it into a powerful jet that slams into your foe.

You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the jet to strike your target (effectively a ray). If your attack is successful, the energetic waters deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage, plus 1d6 additional damage for every 2 levels beyond 1st, to a maximum of 5d6 damage at 9th level. Additionally, the target must succeed on a Foritude save or be pushed directly away from you 5 ft. If this space is occupied, they fall prone in that square.
