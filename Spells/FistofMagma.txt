You plunge your fist into the earth, but as you draw it out again it it now has the appearance of molten rock, dripping somewhat onto the ground.

This spell functions as "fist of stone." In addition, however, you deal an additional 1d6 fire damage with your slam attack and when you successfully make a grapple check to damage an opponent as part of a grapple.
