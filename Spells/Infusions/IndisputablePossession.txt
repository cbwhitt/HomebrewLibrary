Target: Item
Duration: 10 min./level
Saving Throw: None (object)
Spell Resistance: No (object)

This infusion creates a bond between you and the object. If it ever leaves your possession, you can call it back to your hand as a move action. The bond is severed if the item is out of your possession for more than 1 minute per caster level. A creature holding onto an item you are trying to retreive can make a Will save to retain its grasp on the item, but that creature must be holding or waring it, not merely carrying the object among its possessions.
