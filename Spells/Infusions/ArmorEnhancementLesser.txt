The imbued armor or shield gains a special ability commonly found on magic armor or shields. You can choose any special ability whose market price is equivalent to a +1 bonus or up to 5000 gp, such as 'light fortification' or 'shadow'. The armor or shield does not need to have an existing enhancement bonus, nor does it gain one when you imbue it with this infusion.
