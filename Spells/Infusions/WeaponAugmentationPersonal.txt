The imbued weapon gains a special ability commonly found on magic weapons. You can choose any special ability whose market price is equivalent to a +1 bonus or up to 10000 gp, such as 'flaming' or 'keen'. The weapon need not an existing enhancement bonus, nor does it gain one when you imbue it with this infusion. The weapon gains the benefit of the infusion only if YOU wield, throw, or fire it.
