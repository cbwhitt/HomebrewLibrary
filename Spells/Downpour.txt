As you finish wiggling your fingers, the air above you thickens with moisture as grey clouds form and begin shedding raindrops.

You cause clouds to gather and a heavy rain to fall. The rain reduces visibility ranges by half, resulting in a -4 penalty on Spot and Search checks. It also automatically extinguishes unprotected flames. Ranged weapon attacks and Listen checks take a -4 penalty. Fire damage in this spell's area is reduced by 1 point per die of damage.
The water created by this spell pools at places along the ground, but evaporates very soon thereafter and therefore does not accumulate significantly (e.g. as might cause a flood).
