You slam your fists into the ground, causing the earth to crack and surge in a ripple around you, carrying nearby enemies (and allies) back.

This spell initiates a bull rush against all other creatures at ground level within range, with a bonus of 5 plus 1 per caster level above first, to a maximum of +10 at 6th level.
If the creature is forced back at least ten feet, they suffer 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage.
