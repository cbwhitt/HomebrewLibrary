With a snap of your fingers, a blast of wind emanates from you, disorienting your foes.

Creatures within the area take 1d4 bludgeoning damage from the buffeting winds, plus 1d4 damage for every two levels beyond 1st, to a maximum of 3d4 damage at 5th level. A Fortitude save negates this damage.
Additionally, creatures caught within the blast receive a -2 penalty on attack rolls until the start of your next turn, regardless of whether they saved.
