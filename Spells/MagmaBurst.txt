As you finish channeling the heat of the deep earth through your core, you stomp your foot and the ground near you explodes in a small burst of molten and solid rock.

Every creature in the area takes 1d6 points of fire damage and 1d6 points of bludgeonong damage from the explosion of semi-molten rock. A successful Reflex save reduces this damage by half. The explosion coats the area in globs of molten rock for 1 round per caster level thereafter. Other creatures that start their turn in this area take an additional 1d6 fire damage from the heat.
