:: House Rules ::


Heighten Spell:
	Heighten spell is not a feat. All spellcasters can innately heighten spells by preparing (in the case of casters that prepare) or casting (in the case of spontaneous casters) them in a higher-level spell slot. Any feat with Heighten Spell as an explicit prerequisite loses that prerequisite.


Leveling Up:
	Unless otherwise specified, gaining a character level takes 80 in-game hours of training. Nor more than 8 hours of training can be gained per in-game day. (10 days at 8 hours/day)
	As a matter of practicality for acquiring class features over the course of this training period (which could be conducted/interspersed as a character continues to adventure), characters can mirror the structure of leveling up that appears in the PHB (pgs. 58-59). That is, a character chooses a class at the end of the first day of training, increases their Base Attack Bonus at the end of the second day of training, increases their Base Save Bonuses at the end of the third, increases their Ability Scores at the end of the fourth, gain additional Hit Points at the end of the fifth, spends new skill points at the end of the sixth, acquires new feats at the end of the 7th, gains access to more spells per day and increases their caster level at the end of the 8th, gains new class features at the end of the 9th, and makes any other changes and is otherwise considered entirely their new level at the end of 10th.


Ability Score Increases:
	Instead of increasing one ability score by a single point every 4 levels, player characters may increase two different ability scores each by one point.


Hit Points:
	When gaining hit points at a level above 1st, a player may either roll the die or take average, at their option. If average is taken, the half a hit point is retained and rounded down when appropriate, such that a player character choosing only the latter option (you may mix and match, if you want) would gain an additional hit point every 2 levels.
	This same choice applies to a player character's minion, campanion, or familiar that may also gain hit dice as the character gains levels. In this case, the choice and result remains if the character gains a replacement companion of the same creature (so a druid choosing to roll for the hit dice of her wolf companion would use those same rolls for all subsequent wolf companions, if her first should perish).


Death and Dying:
	The campaign uses all standard rules for death and dying, with two exceptions. Instead of dying at negative 10 hit points, a player dies at either negative 10 hit points or negative their constitution score, whichever is greater. Additionally, a character has a 20% chance of stabilizing instead of 10%.


Resurrection:
	Most effects that revive a character from the grave (the exception being 'true resurrection') incur a penalty of a lost level upon resurrection. This stipulation is removed. Instead, a revived character simply loses 250 xp per character level they possess. If a character has insufficiently much xp remaining, they cannot be raised.


Feat Retraining:
	A player may retrain any feat he possesses as part of gaining a level, provided: 1. The player replaces that feat with one she could have taken at the level he took the one she is replacing. 2. The feat to be replaced is not the prerequisite for another character option. 3. The feat does not provide a one-time bonus or otherwise cannot be reasonably reversed (such as Leadership).


Combat Expertise:
	The feats Improved Combat Expertise or Superior Combat Expertise have been eliminated. Instead, the Combat Expertise feat has no limit to the dodge bonus you can gain aside from your Base Attack Bonus.


Toughness:
	The feat Improved Toughness has been eliminated. Instead, the toughness feat grants +1 hit point per hit die, but may only be taken once.


Cleric Spontaneous Casting:
	Clerics who channel positive energy can spontaneously cast all spells with the healing descriptor, not just 'cure' spells.


Darkness:
	The spell 'darkness' and its derivatives produce actual darkness, not shadowy illumination. They therefore provide total concealment.


Elementals:
	A number of changes to elementals have been made to support a fuller elemental themes for some of my settings.
	Firstly, for relevant settings, the concepts of 'positive energy' and 'negative energy' have primarily been eliminated. They are instead merely aspects of the new elements of 'Light' and 'Dark'. Nevertheless, creatures that use positive and negative energy still function as they had previously. (Undead are harmed by positive energy, etc.) This change usually accompanies a reflavoring or rexcontextualization of the planes as well. To some extent, celestial and infernal creatures, which have the Outsider type, can be considered as the "genie" of the planes of Light and Dark, much the same as efreet are fire genie.
	Additionally, the elemental languages are all rooted in a common Primordial. They all share the Primordial script and mirror some of the basic structure. True Primordial is essentially never spoken (narratively, then it can serve a wide range of roles). However, Primordial has six primary dialects corresponding to the six elements (Terran, Auran, Ignan, Aquan, Luman, Noctan), with further regional dialects that may correspond to paraelements, etc. Celestial and Infernal/Abyssal may be replaced by Luman and Noctan, as appropriate. The dialects are not mutually intelligible, and from a rules perspective are treated as separate languages.
	In settings that use my elemental cosmology and pantheon, the alignment of basic elemental creatures (such as earth elementals or light elementals) is changed to be that of the corresponding emperor or lord (see the setting details for Godai).
	Lastly, there are a number of minor changes to the abilities for the basic elementals, detailed below.
	Air Elementals:
		Air Mastery (Ex):
			An air elemental receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against airborne (flying) creatures.
	Earth Elementals:
		Earth Mastery (Ex):
			An earth elemental receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against creatures touching the ground.
	Fire Elementals:
		Fire Mastery (Ex): [new]
			A fire elemental receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against creatures on fire (e.g. from its burn ability).
	Water Elementals:
		Water Mastery (Ex):
			A water elemental receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against waterborne (swimming) creatures.
		Vortex (Su):
			As description, except that a water elemental need not be in water to transform into a vortex. If not waterborne, however, the maximum height and width of the vortex are each reduced by half. It kicks up dust as normal (i.e. like the air elementals' whirlwind).


Native Subtype:
	In addition to the other properties of the native subtype for outsiders, a native outsider does not receive any weapons proficiencies as a result of her type.


Tower Shields:
	There are many clarifications and expansions of the rules for tower shields in the FAQs, which are largely a result of treating the tower shield as a piece of terrain. As a clarification of my own: If you are wielding two (or more) tower shields simultaneously, you can claim cover from each of them on your own with a single standard action (thereby providing protection over multiple edges of your space).


Homunculus Subtype:
	As a clarifying detail, I have added a homunculus subtype for construct creatures. See below.
	Homunculi are constructs that are irrevocably linked to their creators. They are constructed and designed to carry out specific tasks and are effective tools for magical artisans.
	Homunculi are extensions of their creators, and as such always share their alignment and same basic nature. Additionally, unlike many constructs, homunculi are intelligent creatures.
	Homunculi usually cannot speak, but they are linked telepathically with their creators. A homunculus knows what its master knows and convey to them everything it sees or hears out to a distance of 1500 feet. A homunculus never travels beyond this range willingly, though it can be removed forcibly. If this occurs, the creature does everything in its power to regain contact with its master.
	An attack that destroys a homunculus deals 2d10 points of damage to its master, and if its master is slain, the homunculus also dies.


Infusions:
	Alchemists, arcanists, and armorers use infusions. Though they are not spellcasters in the usual way, but they do have the ability to replicate spell effects by imbuing them into items, essentially creating temporary magic items that they can employ. They do so through infusions. Infusions function just like spells, and they follow the rules of spells. For example, they can be dispelled or counterspelled, they don't function in an antimagic area, and a character must make a Concentration check if injured while imbuing one. Additionally, the magic of infusions is arcane in nature. Infusions can be viewed as a special class of spells, but since all infusions share some common characteristics and deliver their spell effects in an atypical way, it is more useful to describe these common mechanics than to reiterate them for each infusion individually. Indeed, many infusion produce effects directly analogous to existing spells and differ only in the delivery of that effect.
	While spells may target one or more creatures, allow you to make an attack, or create some instantaneous or persistent effect in an area, all infusions are imbued into an item or construct and produce a persistent effect that effectively turns that object temporarily into a magic item which delivers the spell effect associated with the infusion. The nature of this delivery varies between the classes. Alchemists imbue spell effects to create temporary brewed items, which grant their spell effects as those brewed items normally would; arcanists use virgery, imbuing spell effects into wands and similar items from which the spells can subsequently be cast; and armorers imbue spell effects to create magical arms, armor, or other items, whose spell effects either modify the item or construct, emanate out from it, or are granted to the item's bearer.
	However, there are rules common amongst all classes. For all infusions, once imbued, the source of the produced effect is the item. These items can be employed by other characters. For example, an armorer may imbue an item worn by her ally with the infusion 'bull's strength' (which is directly analogous to the spell of the same name. The item then functions similarly to a belt of giant strength for the duration of the infusion, granting her ally a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength. As another example, an alchemist may create a temporary potion, imbuing it with the spell 'cure light wounds'. The created potion thus works the same as a potion of 'cure light wounds' would.
	Imbuing an infusion requires one minute with the item, construct, or materials necessary and is otherwise similar to casting a spell. Unlike most spells, though, once imbued, the infusion does not produce its effect immediately. Instead, the item stores the spell effect within itself until the infusion is activated or until you receive a new daily allotment of infusions, at which point the magic of all extant infusions fades away. All decisions needed for infusions (for example, which special weapon ability is granted by the 'personal weapon augmentation' infusion) are made when they are imbued. The entries for each class detail more comprehensively how each uses and activates infusions.


Infusions and Activating Magic Items:
	Ordinarily, a character must, for example, know a spell to be able to cast it from a spell completion item (i.e. a scroll), have it on their spell list to activate a spell trigger item (e.g. a wand), or have it prepared/available to cast (depending on whether they prepare spell) to flavor a universal potion with it. Infusions which have analogue spells qualify for all such purposes (so an arcanist can activate magic wands for spells that appear on his spell list and an alchemist can flavor a universal potion with the spell effect of any infusion he knows).


Use Magic Device and Emulating Spell Requirements for Creating Magic Items:
	A character can emulate knowing a spell necessary for creating a magic item with a Use Magic Device check (DC 20 + spell level emulated). To craft the item, the character must still expend a spell slot of the corresponding level when doing so. If the check fails, you may retry each day over the course of crafting the item. If the time to craft the item elapses and you have not succesfully emulated the spell (or other requirement using the normal Use Magic Device rules), you must artificially extend the time needed to craft the item by as many days as is necessary. You may take 20 on this check, but it represents taking at least 20 days to craft the item.


Crafting Mundane Items:
	The rules for crafting mundane items using the Craft skills are modified. The steps to craft an item are as follows.
	1. Calculate the item's price in gold pieces.
	2. Determine the Difficulty Class of crafting the item (reference the Craft skill description).
	3. Acquire raw materials from which to craft the item, costing one-third of its price.
	4. Calculate the base crafting time of the item. This represents a standardized amount of time to complete the item: skilled craftspeople will take less than this time, while unskilled craftspeople will take more. To calculate the base time, divide the price by 15 gp, then exponentiate this ratio by .4771; this is the base crafting time in (work) weeks (for those interested, the exact power is ln(3) / ln(10); this means that an item that costs 10 times as much takes 3 times as long to craft).
	5. Craft the item over one or more intervals of time:
		a. The base crafting time of the item becomes the remaining time.
		b. Commit a period of time to spend working toward crafting the item. You may specify as much or as little time as you like. The standard unit of time is a work week, equivalent to 56 hours of work (7 of 10 days, 8 hours each working day).
		c. Make a Craft check representing your work over this period of time. You make some progress on the item regardless of your check result, but if you fail the DC by 5 or more, you waste half of your raw materials and must acquire them again (costing therefore 1/6 the price of the item).
		d. Deduct the Difficulty Class from your check result, then divide this difference by 5. Exponentiate 2 by this quotient. Multiply this by the amount of time you commited to crafting the item this period to determine your earned time. If this earned time meets the remaining time, you finish the item in the time you committed. If it exceeds the remaining time, you need only spend a correspondingly smaller proportion of the time you committed (for example, if your earned time is double the remaining time, it takes only half the time you committed to actually craft the item; essentially, for every 5 by which you exceed the DC, you work twice as effectively/quick.
		e. If your earned time does not exceed the base crafting time, deduct your earned time from the remaining time. The item is partially finished. Repeat steps b-d until the item is finished.

	You may intersperse the time you commit to crafting among other activities. Working in units of work weeks assumes that there are three days each week that you do not work and that you spend only 8 hours each day that you do actually working.
	You may also craft multiple copies of the same item simultaneously. Treat this is a single item whose cost is the total of the costs of the individual items (this makes it more expedient then crafting them individually). The items are crafted in parallel, such that no items are finished until all items are finished. You can only craft items of the same kind that are not substantially different from each other (so, for example, using Craft (alchemy) one could make multiple uses' worth of alchemist's fire, but someone using Craft (armorsmithing) could not make multiple full plate mail suits in the same way, since they must be made to fit the wearer).
