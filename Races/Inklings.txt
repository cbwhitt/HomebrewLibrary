:: Inklings ::

	Inklings stand between 5 and 6 ft. tall and have very slight builds, using four tentacles as legs and saving another pair to use as arms. They very closely resemble squid, using their sharp beaks to eay and speak. Inklings are a secluded and quiet people; they often live in dark cities nestled within the depths of the ocean. They have a tendency toward intellectual pursuits, ranging from qizardry and other magical arts to martial prowess, and most have an innate knack for magical tinkering.
