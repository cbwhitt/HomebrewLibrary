:: Terrans ::

	+2 Strength, -2 Dexterity
	Outsider (native, earth, primordial)
	Medium: As Medium creatures, terrans have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
	Terran base land speed is 30 feet.
	Darkvision
	Stony Skin: A terran's hard skin, which varies from stony to crystalline, grants it a +1 racial bonus to natural armor.
	Stonecunning: This ability grants a terran a +2 racial bonus on Search checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and the like. Something that isn't stone but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A terran who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search check as if he were actively searching, and a terran can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A terran can also intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up.
