:: Sprigkin ::

	Sprigkin are a civilized race of fey. They stand between 2-1/2 and 3 ft. tall and weigh 25-30 lb. Their skin ranges from fair to miscellaneous cool tones like a faint blue, purple, or mint green. They have distinctly fairy or pixie-like features, including disproportionately large heads and eyes and vestigial membranous wings. Sprigkin prefer colorful clothing adorned with natural iconography. Sprigkin reach adulthood at about age 30 and they live about 300 years, with the oldest living to around 400.
