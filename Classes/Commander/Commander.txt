Weapon and Armor Proficiency:
	Commanders are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).

Commands:
	A commander is a master of battlefield strategy, guiding their comrades to victory. This mastery manifests in commands that the commander issues to their allies. A commander automatically gains access to new commands as they gain class levels. A commander need not prepare a command in advance: every command to which they have access (determined by their commander level) is available for their use.
	Every command targets at least one of a commander’s allies, directing them to perform some sort of action. Commands also specify a restriction on the frequency of their use, usually as a number of rounds a commander must wait before issuing the same command again.  Some commands also allow the commander to achieve greater effect, the additional cost for which is specified. A commander may issue any command they know, provided the command is ready to use. Issuing a command is a standard action unless otherwise specified.
Commands most often allow a commander’s allies to perform extra actions outside of their normal initiative order. This does not change their position in the initiative order and may result in one of your allies performing an action on your turn immediately followed by a full round of actions on their turn. A character granted actions in addition to their regular turn by a command may not benefit from multiple such abilities in 1 round, even if issued by another commander. An ally cannot act before their first action (i.e. at the start of combat) as part of one of your commands, nor can they perform actions they are physically incapable of (e.g. a helpless ally bound in chains by your enemies cannot move or make an attack).
Unless otherwise specified, only allies that can see, hear, or otherwise perceive them can benefit from a commander’s commands. A commander is considered their own ally and may therefore benefit from their own commands, where applicable.
The save DC for a commander’s commands (if applicable) is 10 + one-half their commander level + their intelligence modifier.
Each command specifies a minimum Intelligence score a commander must possess in order to use it.
A full list of commands, at what level a commander gains access to them, and their effects can be found below:

-----

	Choose an enemy. Up to two allies may immediately move their speed as a move action. Each step of their movement must bring them closer to the chosen enemy. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as it otherwise would.
	A commander must wait 1 round before issuing this command again.
	A commander gains access to this command at 1st level.
	A commander must have an Intelligence score of at least 11 to issue this command.

To attempt this Hide check, they must have cover or concealment or be within range (see the Hide skill description for additional details) of cover or concealment. If they move into cover or concealment, they still get the -10 penalty to their Hide check. If any allies are being even casually observed by an enemy, they must make a Bluff check as normal to use Hide. However, you may also make a Bluff check (if you are also using Hide as a part of issuing this command and must make a Bluff check yourself, you use that check result for this as well). Your allies may use either their Bluff check results or yours, whichever is higher.
	Until the start of each ally’s next action, whenever an enemy enters a square that ally threatens, that enemy provokes an attack of opportunity from that ally if that ally is hidden from that enemy.

Skill Focus (Diplomacy):
	Because a commander has a way with people, they gain Skill Focus (Diplomacy) as a bonus feat at 1st level.

Motivation (Ex):
	 A commander is a master of motivating their comrades, and can keep their spirits high, edging them on to their best. Once per day, plus one additional time per day for every three commander levels they have, a commander may give an ally a morale bonus on any skill check equal to their Intelligence bonus (if any). A commander must be nearby and able to encourage their ally, and they cannot also use the aid another action to help with the same skill check.

Tactics (Ex):
	Beginning at 2nd level, a commander learns to employ various sets of tactics on the battlefield. They can learn to implement different tactics over the course of their career. They may employ up to one tactic at a time.
	Employing a tactic is a swift action. The tactic remains in effect until the commander uses a free action to dismiss it or employs another tactic. A commander can have a tactic active continually; thus, a tactic can be in effect at the start of a combat encounter even before they take their first turn.
Employing a tactic involves haranguing, ordering, directing, encouraging, cajoling, or calming allies. A commander sizes up the enemy, allies, and the terrain, then gives allies the direction that they need to do their best.
	Unless otherwise noted, a commander’s tactics affect all allies that can see, hear, or otherwise perceive them (including themself). An ally must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher to gain the bonus. A commander’s tactic is dismissed if they are dazed, unconscious, stunned, paralyzed, or otherwise unable to be heard or understood by their allies.
Tactics provide a +1 bonus (or some equivalent) on certain rolls (or equivalent). This bonus increases to +2 at 8th level, to +3 at 14th level, and to +4 at 20th level.
At second level, a commander learns one tactic of their choice. At 5th, 9th, 14th, and 20th levels, a commander learns one new tactic of their choice.
	A full list of tactics appears below.

-----
Hardy Soldiers: The commander’s allies gain damage reduction equal to the amount of bonus their tactics provide. For example, if they are 10th level, their affected allies gain DR 2/–.

Ardorous Blows: The commander’s allies gain a morale bonus on melee damage rolls equal to their tactics bonus.

Combat Prowess: The commander’s allies gain a morale bonus on melee attack rolls equal to their tactics bonus.

Take Care: The commander’s allies gain a dodge bonus to Armor Class equal to their tactics bonus.

With Urgency: All forms of movement of the commander’s allies are increased by 5 feet per point of tactics they possess. For example, the allies of a 10th level commander add 10 feet to all of their speeds. This ability does not grant forms of movement to their allies that they do not already possess. This speed may be reduced by armor or encumbrance, as appropriate.

Resilient Troops: The commander’s allies gain a morale bonus on all saves equal to their tactics bonus.

Steady Hand: The commander’s allies gain a morale bonus on all ranged attack rolls equal to their tactics bonus.

Keen Eye: The commander’s allies gain a morale bonus on all ranged damage rolls equal to their tactics bonus.
-----

Leadership:
	At 6th level, a commander gains Leadership as a bonus feat. They automatically qualify for the “great renown” modifier to their Leadership score (as a result of their prestigious/honored background).

Signature Command (Ex):
	At 9th level, a commander develops a signature command, a battlefield technique they're known for implementing very well. They select one command. They must wait one step (e.g. from 1d6+1 to 1d4+1, from 1d4+1 to 1d4, from 1d4 to 1d3, from 1d3 to 1, and from 1 to 1) fewer rounds to use that command again, for all of its modes. As an example, Lady Windgrace, a 9th-level commander, chooses the command Guard Up. When she uses it in its standard mode as a standard action, she waits only 1 round (instead of 1d3) before she can issue Guard Up again. Additionally, when she uses it in its enhanced mode (as an immediate action), she need only wait 1d4+1 rounds before issuing it again.
	A commander develops additional signature commands at 13th, 17th, and 20th level. They may not select the same command more than once.

Mixed Tactics (Ex):
	At 12th level, a commander becomes able to blend tactics together. They may employ up to two tactics at a time (instead of one). It is now a free action to dismiss one or both of their employed tactics. When they use a swift action to employ a tactic, if they already have two tactics active, they select one of their two tactics to replace with the new one. (If they have less than two tactics active, the new tactic simply becomes active.)
	In employing these tactics, a commander divides the total bonus of their tactics ability (+2 when they gain this ability at 12th level) between their employed tactics, and they may adjust the distribution of bonus points automatically whenever they employ a new tactic or as a swift action. For example, Lady Windgrace, a 12th-level commander, knows the Ardorous Blows, Combat Prowess, and Take Care tactics. She already has Take Care active (at a +2 bonus). As a swift action on her next turn, she employs the Combat Prowess tactic, choosing to split the bonus evenly between the two abilities, at +1 apiece. Her allies therefore gain a +1 dodge bonus to their AC and a +1 morale bonus on all melee attack rolls.
