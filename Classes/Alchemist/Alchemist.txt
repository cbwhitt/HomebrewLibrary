Weapon and Armor Proficiency:
	An alchemist is proficient with all simple weapons and with the calculus. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.

Infusions:
	An alchemist is not a spellcaster in the typical sense, but he does have the ability to create temporary brewed items which produce spell effects. He does so through infusions. The way an alchemist uses infusions is straightforward: he uses them to create impermanent versions of brewed items. Essentially, he hastily assembles a brewed item from different components he has on hand in his alchemical components pouch and binds them together with a smidgen of alchemical magic, the infusion. For example, an alchemist who knows the infusion 'cure light wounds' could spend one minute (since infusions generally take 1 minute to imbue) mixing together ingredients and then stopper them into a vial. The potion so created works exactly like a true potion of 'cure light wounds', except that the magic of the item is maintained by the infusion (and could, for example, fade away when the alchemist receives a new daily allotment of infusions). In all cases, since the source of the effect is the item, it is transferrable inasmuch as the item can change possession. An alchemist's allies can find just as much use out of the items he emulates with his infusions as he can.
	To imbue infusions in this way, an alchemist must have the item creation feat corresponding to the brewed item he wishes to emulate. He need only spend the one minute it takes to imbue an infusion, however, and there is no base cost associated with imbuing the infusion (the infusion only emulates the quality of a magic item). An alchemist ordinarily may not imbue multiple infusions into the same item in this way, though eventually he may within the abilities granted him by the volatile concoction class feature.
	To learn or use an infusion, an alchemist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the infusion level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an effect produced by an alchemist's infusion is 10 + the infusion level + ther alchemist's Intelligence modifier. His caster level for these effects is his alchemist level. All infusions require an alchemist to have access to a pouch full of miscellaneous alchemical ingredients when imbued.
	An alchemist can only use so many infusions of each infusion level per day. He needs 8 hours of rest to regain his infusions for the day. His base daily infusion allotment is shown in the table above. In addition, he receives bonus infusions per day if he has a high Intelligence score. The number of bonus infusions is equivalent to the number of bonus spells granted to a spellcaster for having a high ability score.
	An alchemist does not have an explicit infusion list the way an armorer does, since all his infusions manifest as brewed items, which are containers for explicit spell effects. Instead, there exists implicitly for each arcane spell that can be incorporated into a brewed item of the appropriate type an equivalent infusion of the same name, which produces a spell effect that functions identically to it. That is, there is an infusion 'cure light wounds' for the spell 'cure light wounds' and an infusion 'enlarge person' for the spell 'enlarge person', etc.
	Though the temporary brewed items created by an alchemist's infusions have to inherent cost, when imbuing an infusion the alchemist must still consume any costly material components, pay any xp cost, and have on hand any needed focus. These costs are forfeit if the magic of the infusion lapses.
	Like a spellcaster, an alchemist can apply metamagic feats he knows when using an infusion. The metamagic applies to the spell effect created by the infusion, as opposed to the imbuing of the infusion itself. Imbuing an infusion in this way takes no more time than usual.
	An alchemist may know any number of infusions. However, the exact details of the alchemical formulae are difficult to memorize and must be recorded in a journal (see below). He need not prepare his infusions in advance. He may imbue any infusion he knows at any time, provided he has his journal at hand and has not yet used up his infusions per day for that level.

Journals:
	The complexity of an alchemist's infusions are such that they cannot be memorized and must instead be recorded in a journal. An alchemist must reference his journal to use his infusions. He cannot use an infusion not recorded in his journal.
	Alchemists begin play with a journal containing 3 1st-level infusions. For each point of Intelligence bonus the alchemist has, the journal holds one additional 1st-level infusion of your choice. At each new alchemist level, he gains two new infusions of any infusion level or levels that he can use (based on his new level) for his journal. At any time, an alchemist can also develop an infusion and add it to his journal or copy from a scroll of the equivalent spell the same way a wizard can incorporate additional spells into her spellbook. Writing an infusion into his journal, aside from the two free infusions he gains at every level, costs the same as writing a spell into a spellbook. Journals otherwise function identically to spellbooks.
	To develop an infusion, an alchemist must have witnessed the corresponding spell effect, or have read or been given a very detailed account of it. He must conduct experiments to replicate the effects of the spell with alchemical ingredients, which takes 1 hour per infusion level. At the end of his experiments, he must succeed on a Craft (alchemy) check. The DC for this check is 20 + the minimum caster level necessary for the arcane spell effect observed. If he succeeds, the infusion is added to his journal, otherwise, he fails, and must begin his experiments anew if he wishes to add the infusion to his journal. An alchemist may take 20 on this check, but it represents 20 experimentsâ€™ worth of time.

Magical Artisan:
	An alchemist gains every brewing feat as a bonus feat at or near the level at which it becomes available to normal spellcasters, regardless of whether he meets the prerequisites. He gains Brew Potion at 1st level, Brew Spellvial at 3rd level, Brew Spellbomb at 4th level, and Brew Universal Potion at 6th level.
	When crafting a magic item, an alchemist may use an infusion in his journal in place of the corresponding spell. For example, to craft a true potion of 'cure light wounds', an alchemist can use the infusion 'cure light wounds' in the same way a normal spellcaster would use the spell of the same name. For all other spells, he must emulate knowing the spell using the Use Magic Device skill or have access to another magic item that stores the spll as normal. An alchemist's skill working with magic items provides him a +4 bonus to Use Magic Device checks to emulate knowing spells made in this way.

Spontaneous Alchemy (Ex):
	As long as an alchemist has his alchemical components pouch on hand, he can near-instantaneously create from those components a number of special substances and items. Items so created have no associated cost or skill check (like when using the Craft skill), but they lose their potency very quickly. An item not used within 1 round becomes inert and unusable. Creating an item in this way is a swift action unless otherwise specified, and some items carry special restrictions on their use. Otherwise, items created through this ability function exactly like their normal counterparts. An alchemist gains access to creating new spontaneous alchemical items this way as he gains alchemist levels, indicated in the table below.

Grenadier:
	An alchemist gains Grenadier as a bonus feat at 2nd level.

Volatile Concoction (Ex):
	Starting at 5th level, you gain the ability to stably synthesize multiple spell effects into a brewed item. When creating a brewed item, you can split the spell level of the item between two different spell effects whose spell levels total the original spell level of the item. The total spell level stored in the item this way cannot exceed the maximum spell level you can imbue in a brewed item (3rd usuall, but later modified by the master alchemist ability). The item has one caster level, and each spell effect in the item uses this caster level. The minimum caster level of the brewed item is the minimum caster level for a recipe corresponding to the total spell level. For example, an alchemist of 6th level using this feature could create a potion of 'expeditious retreat' and 'jump'; 'expeditious retreat' and 'jump' are both 1st-level spell effects, for a total spell level of 2; the caster level of the potion therefore has a minimum of 4th and a maximum of 6th (the alchemistâ€™s). In the case of  universal potions or other potential brewed items where the spell effect is determined at activation and not at creation, an alchemist using this ability instead determines the number and level of spell effects that can be imbued in the potion upon its activation (a 7th level alchemist could therefore create using this ability a 3rd-level universal potion split between a 2nd-level spell effect and a 1st-level spell effect, both of these effects being imbued by the user upon its activation).
	At 10th, 15th, and 20th level, this ability improves, allowing an alchemist using this ability to create brewed items with up to 3, 4, and 5 total spell effects, respectively.

Down the Hatch (Ex):
	An alchemistâ€™s mastery of potions allows him to use them more efficiently and effectively. Beginning at 8th level, an alchemist may drink one potion each round as a swift action instead of a standard action. Doing so does not provoke an attack of opportunity. He may still use his standard action to consume another potion.
	At 18th level, this ability improves. An alchemist of at least 18th level may drink up to two potions as a swift action.

Master Alchemist (Ex):
	At 10th level, the maximum spell level you can imbue into a potion, quick potion, spellvial, universal potion, or another brewed item increases to 4th, beyond the normal limit.
	At 13th level and 16th level, this ability improves by one additional level (to a maximum of 6th-level spells at 16th level).
