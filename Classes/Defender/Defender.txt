Class Skills: (2 + Int modifier per level, x4 at 1st level):

Craft (Int), Intimidate (Cha), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spot (Wis)
 
Weapon and Armor Proficiency:
	A defender is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, all types of armor, and shields (including tower shields).

AC Bonus (Ex):
	The defender receives a dodge bonus to Armor Class that starts at +0 and improves as the defender gains levels (see Table: The Defender).

Advanced Shield Proficiency:
	A defender gains Improved Shield Bash and Tower Shield Master as bonus feats at 1st level.

Defensive Stance (Ex):
	A defender can adopt a defensive stance a certain number of times per day, fortifying themself at the cost of their mobility. They gain a +2 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws, and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The increase in Constitution increases the defender’s hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the defensive stance when their Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are.) While in a defensive stance, a defender may not move or use abilities that would require them to move into a new square except that they can take one five-foot step each turn. If a defender is moved against their will (e.g. an opponent bull rushes them), they maintain their stance. If they are knocked prone (e.g. an opponent trips them), they maintain their stance and can stand up as normal, their stance simply restricts their ability to move into new squares. Though a defender can be forced to move while in a defensive stance, doing so is difficult. They are considered exceptionally stable while in their defensive stance.
	A defensive stance lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the defender’s (newly improved) Constitution modifier and ends if they fall unconscious. A defender may voluntarily end their defensive stance prior to this limit. At the end of the defensive stance, they are winded and take a -2 penalty to Strength for 1 hour. A defender can only use their defensive stance a certain number of times per day, as determined by their level (see Table: The Defender). Adopting or leaving a defensive stance is a free action.

Bonus Feats:
	At 2nd level, and again at every 4th level (4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th) a defender gains a bonus combat-oriented feat. These bonus feats must be one marked as a fighter bonus feat. A defender must still meet all the prerequisites for these bonus feats, but qualifies as a fighter of level equivalent to their defender level for this purpose.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex):
	Starting at 2nd level, a defender retains their Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (They still lose any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.)
	If a character gains uncanny dodge from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below).

Trap Sense (Ex):
	At 3rd level, a defender gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At every 3rd level thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1. These bonuses stack with trap sense bonuses gained from other classes.

Damage Reduction (Ex):
	At 5th level, a defender gains damage reduction. Subtract 2 points from the damage the defender takes each time they are dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At every fifth level thereafter, this damage reduction rises by 2 points. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):
	At 5th level, a defender can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the defender by flanking them, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the defender has defender levels. If a character already has uncanny dodge from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level a rogue must be to flank the character.

Mobile Stance (Ex):
	At 7th level, a defender becomes more mobile. Once per turn, a defender may move up to their land speed as a move action without losing the benefit of their stance. They may not charge or withdraw, however, even though these abilities are normally allowed when characters have limited actions (it is not their actions which are limited, but their movement itself.)
	At 13th level, a defender becomes fully mobile. They may move as they please without losing the benefit of their stance, including running, charging, withdrawing, and the like.

Shared Stance (Ex):
	At 9th level, a defender becomes especially skilled at protecting their allies. While they are in a defensive stance, allies adjacent to them receive a resistance bonus on all saving throws and a dodge bonus to AC equal to one-half those the defender gains while in their defensive stance, rounded down. Additionally, they are considered exceptionally stable for the purposes of trip attacks and the like (receiving the full +4 bonus).
	At 19th level, this ability improves. A defender's allies need only be within 15 feet of them while they are in a defensive stance to receive these bonuses.

Greater Stance (Ex):
	At 11th level, a defender’s bonuses to Strength and Constitution during their defensive stance increase to +4 and +6, respectively, their resistance bonus on all saves increases to +3, and their dodge bonus to AC increases to +5.

Interpose (Ex):
	At 14th level, the defender gains the ability to interpose themself between an enemy and one of their allies. Once per round, when an adjacent ally is attacked, a defender may have that attack target them instead. When interposing themself in this way, a defender forfeits any size, Dexterity, or dodge bonuses to their AC (but not penalties). A defender need not be in a defensive stance to use this ability.

Tireless Stance (Ex):
	Starting at 17th level, a defender no longer takes a -2 penalty to Strength at the end of their defensive stance.

Mighty Stance (Ex):
	At 20th level, a defender’s bonuses to Strength and Constitution during their defensive stance increase to +6 and +8, respectively, their resistance bonus on all saves increases to +4, and their dodge bonus to AC increases to +6.
