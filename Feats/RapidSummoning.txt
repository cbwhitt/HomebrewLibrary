:: Rapid Summoning ::
[General]

Prequisites:
	Spell focus (conjuration)
Benefit:
	When casting a summoning spell whose casting time is ordinarily 1 round, its casting time is 1 standard action instead. (Creatures so summoned can only take a standard action in the round they are summoned.) Additionally, these spells gain the normal benefits from being enhanced with the Quicken Spell feat.
