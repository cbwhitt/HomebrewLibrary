:: Superior Summoning ::
[General]

Prequisites:
	Spell focus (conjuration), augment summoning, improve summoning
Benefit:
	When using a 'summon' spell to summon creatures from a lower-level list than the level of spell you are using, you summon one additional creature of the same kind. This also applies if you heighten a 'summon' spell above its normal spell level.
