[General]

Benefit:
	You are considered proficient in the use of siege weapons.
	Additionally, when operating a siege engine, you may take the actions required to prepare it to attack as standard actions instead of full-round actions.

Normal:
	Ordinary characters are not proficient with siege weapons and incur a -4 penalty on attacks made with them, and it takes a full-round action to perform one of the actions to prepare the engine to attack.
