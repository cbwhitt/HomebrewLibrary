:: Sniper ::
[General]

Prerequisites:
	Point blank shot, precise shot, Dex 15, sneak attack special ability

Benefit:
	Ranged attacks you make can count as sneak attacks if the target is within 150 feet.
	Additionally, when using the Hide skill to snipe (see the hide skill description), you take only a -15 penalty to your Hide check to conceal yourself after the shot.

Normal:
	Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet, and you take a -20 penalty to your Hide check to try to conceal yourself after attacking at range.
