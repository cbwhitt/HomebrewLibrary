:: Brew Spellvial ::
[Item Creation, Brewing]

Prequisites:
	Brew Potion, caster level 3rd
Benefit:
	You can brew spellvials, potion-like concoctions that can be used as thrown weapons. You create the spellvial just as you would any other potion; the spell stored within must be of 3rd level or lower and capable of targeting a creature or object other than the caster. For example, 'hold person', 'slow', and 'invisibility' can all be made into spellvials, but 'false life' and 'fireball' cannot, because they either target only the caster ('false life') or don't target a particular creature or object ('fireball'). Even spells that include nontargeted effects (such as 'dispel magic') can be incorporated if they include a targeted effect as well. Only the targeted effect functions.
	Activating a spellvial is a swift action. After being activated, a spellvial can be thrown as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet; if not thrown within one round, the spellvial deactivates and must be activated again. A spellvial that is consumed as a potion has no effect on that creature, even if the spell it holds is beneficial. If the spellvial hits the target, treat the target as if the spell had been cast on it; saving throws and spell resistance apply normally. Spellvials have no splash effect.
	The base price of a spellvial is its spell level x its caster level x 50 gp. To brew a spellvial, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in xp and use up raw materials costing one half this base price. Brewing a spellvial takes 1 day. When you create a spellvial, you make any choices that would normally be made when casting the spell. Any spellvial that stores a spell with a constly material component or an xp cost also carries a commensurate cost; in addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the xp when creating the spellvial.
