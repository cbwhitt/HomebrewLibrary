:: Dual Shield Defense ::
[Fighter]

Prequisites:
	Improved shield bash

Benefit:
	You can effectively leverage wielding two shields simultaneously. When you bear two shields, you may add one half the shield bonus of the shield in your off hand (rounded down, minimum 1) to your AC in addition to the shield bonus of the other shield. Effectively, use of the two shields combines to grant you a single shield bonus.

Normal:
	A character, though capable of wielding two shields, does not receive the bonus from both shields.

Special:
	A fighter may select dual shield defense as one of his fighter bonus feats.
