:: Alchemist's Spark ::
Weight: 1 lb.
Cost: 15 gp

Alchemist's spark combines two substances that react violently when mixed.
A flask has two compartments that keep the substances separate; throwing the flask shatters it allows them to mix, releasing a powerful electric discharge.
Otherwise, alchemist's spark functions like alchemist's fire, except it deals 1d8 points of electricity damage on direct hit and 1 point of electricity damage to those it splashes, rather than fire damage.
It deals no additional damage after the initial damage.
