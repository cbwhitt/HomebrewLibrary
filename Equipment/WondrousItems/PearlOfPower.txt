:: Pearl of Power ::

	This seemingly normal pearl of average size and luster is a potent aid to all spellcasters. The magic of a pearl of power functions once per day. For spellcasters that prepare spells (such as clerics or wizards), on command, a pearl of power enables them to recall any one spell that they have cast that day (having prepared it earlier). The spell is prepared again, just as if it had not been cast. Doing so is a free action. For spellcasters that cast spells spontaneously (such as bards and sorcerers), instead, when casting a spell, they may choose to draw power from the pearl as a free action. If they do, they need not expend a spell slot for the casting of that spell.
	Each pearl of power has a maximum level of spell for which it functions, between 1st and 9th level. When using a pearl of power, a spellcaster may apply its effect to any spell of equal or lower level than the pearl's. The price and aura of a pearl vary based on is level.
