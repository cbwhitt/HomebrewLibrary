	A meteor hammer has reach, so you can strike opponents 10 ft. away with it. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, it can be used against an adjacent foe.
	You can make trip attacks with the meteor hammer. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the meteor hammer to avoid being tripped.
	You can use the weapon finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a meteor hammer sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon for you.
	A meteor hammer is a special mystic weapon. This designation gives a mystic wielding a meteor hammer special options.
