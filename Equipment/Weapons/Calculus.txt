	This oversized sling is designed to throw splash weapons. Ammunition deals damage according to its properties, but it gains the range increment of the calculus. When using a calculus to hurl standard sling projectiles, you may apply one and one half your Strength modifier to damage rolls.
	Gnomes treat the calculus as a martial weapon.
