	A ransette has reach. You can strike opponents 10 ft. away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe. You can use a ransette to make disarm attacks. You get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent when doing so (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).
