A light catapult or magonel uses a tensioning device to thorw a heavy stone hundreds of feet. It takes up a space 10 feet across and weighs 2000 pounds.

It requires two full-round actions and a DC 10 Strength check for each to wind the catapult to full cock.
It requires a full-round action and a DC 15 Profession (siege engineer) check to load the ammunition.
It requires two full-round actions to aim the catapult.

A catapult's base accuracy increases by +2 for each time it has missed its target, provided it is aimed again between shots, up to a maximum of +6. This bonus automatically becomes +6 when a catapult hits its target, but resets if the target moves relative to the catapult or if the commander of the catapult changes.
