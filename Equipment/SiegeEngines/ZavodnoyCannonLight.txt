A Zavodnoy light cannon is a smaller version of a Zavodnoy heavy cannon, only 5 feet across and weighing 750 pounds.
It functions identically to its larger counterpart, except that loading a round is a free action, meaning a normal rate of fire is every round.
Additionally, it only takes 2 full-round actions to reload a light cannon:
One action to open the magazine, a DC 10 Profession (siege engineer) check;
and one action to load in the rounds, a DC 10 Strength check.
