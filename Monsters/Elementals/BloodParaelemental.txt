Blood Mastery (Ex):
	A blood paraelemental receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against enemies affected by its persistent wound ability.

Persistent Wound (Su):
	The damage a blood paraelemental deals with its slam attacks causes a persistent and supernatural wound that gradually exsanguinates an afflicted creature. An injured creature loses a number of additional hit points each round based on the elemental's size. The continuing hit point loss can be stopped by a Heal check, a 'cure' spell, or a 'heal' spell (or equivalent), but a character attempting to heal the wound magically in this way must succeed on a caster level check, or the spell has no effect on the injured character. Spells and abilities that amplify natural healing, like 'vigor' or fast healing, function unabated by the persistent wound, but do not themselves cure it. The check DCs are Strength-based.
	A character affected by the persistent wound also has a chance to contract the blood rage, a virulent disease native to the Plane of Blood. When a character is first damaged by the paraelemental's persistent wound, they must make a fortitude save or contract the blood plague. The save DC is the same as for the persistent wound and like other diseases may be rolled in secret.

Blood Rage:
	Spread by creatures native to the Plane of Blood. Symptoms include large bloody tumors that ooze and fall off the body and can spread the disease. Some tumors develop semi-sapience and can crawl slowly toward new hosts. Additionally, as the disease progresses the afflicted develop a violent rage.
Contact, DC varies, Incubation 1 day, Damage Rage, then 1d3 Con (see text).
The first time (after the incubation period) a creature fails a saving throw against the blood rage, instead of taking Constitution damage they develop a violent rage, as the spell 'rage' (including the Constitution bonus), until they die, overcome the disease naturally, or are cured. Each subsequent day, they instead take the listed damage on a failed saving throw. If a creature dies while afflicted with the blood rage, a blood paraelemental two size categories smaller than the creature (if possible) will be created 1d4 hours later, unless the corpse is burned or otherwise rendered to no longer be flesh.
