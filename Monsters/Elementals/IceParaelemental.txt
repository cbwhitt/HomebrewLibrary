Level Adjustment: --

Ice Mastery (Ex):
	An ice paraelemental receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against enemies who have suffered cold damage in the past 5 rounds, or are in snowy terrain (or in an otherwise icy environment such as a snowstorm).

Icewalk (Ex):
	An ice paraelemental can move across or through snow or ice as easily as a fish swims through water. It leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. Correspondingly, ice is not slippery to an ice paraelemental.

Cold (Ex):
	An ice paraelemental's body generates intense cold. It deals extra cold damage on its slam attack, as indicated below. Additionally, creatures attacking an ice paraelemental unarmed or with natural weapons take this same cold damage each time one of their attacks hits.
