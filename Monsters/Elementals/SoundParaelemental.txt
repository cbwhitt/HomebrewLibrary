Sound Mastery (Ex):
	A sound paraelemental receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against fascinated enemies or those who have suffered sonic damage in the past 5 rounds.

Soundscape (Su):
	A sound paraelemental continously emits a complex collection of sounds, producing one of two effects. The paraelemental can switch which effect as a swift action. The save DC for these effects is Constitution-based.
	Euphony: This soundscape is of strange, beautiful music that enraptures opponents. Any creature that starts its turn within range must succeed on a Will saving throw or be affected as though by a 'hypnotism' spell for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting compulsion effect. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same paraelemental's euphony for 10 minutes.
	Cacophony: This soundscape is of loud, discordant blasts of sounds. A creature that starts its turn within range must make a Fortitude save or take sonic damage based on the paraelemental's sie.
